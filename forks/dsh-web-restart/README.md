# dsh-web-restart

One-click restart button for the **DeepSeek Harness Web UI**.

Adds a small circular restart button (↻) to the sidebar footer, next to Settings. A **single click** immediately restarts the `dsh web` process — the page disconnects for ~15–20 seconds, then you refresh and everything is back (sessions are persisted on disk and recover automatically). The button is **persistent**: it survives the restart it triggers.

> Windows-specific: the restart launches `dsh web` through an independent hidden PowerShell process, so the script keeps running after the harness process is killed.

## Features

- Single-click restart — no confirmation step, no double-click dance.
- Persistent: survives the DSH restart it triggers (installed as a bundle-layer plugin, not a dynamic session plugin).
- Small footprint: sits beside the Settings trigger in the sidebar footer; icon-only in the 56px rail, icon + label in the wide sidebar.
- In-flight feedback: the button turns red and shows "重启中…" → "已触发" while the request is being processed.
- Re-entry guard: a second click while a restart is already in flight is rejected.
- Online status dot: the button also shows DSH liveness — a green dot polls `GET /dsh-health` every 5s (red when the harness is unreachable/restarting).

## Install

### From GitHub (this repo)

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add github:YOUR_OWNER/dsh-web-restart
```

Then restart `dsh web` once so the bundle layer loads.

### Manual (edit profile files)

1. Add the dependency:

```jsonc
// ~/.dsh/profiles/web/package.json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "dsh-web-restart": "github:YOUR_OWNER/dsh-web-restart"
  }
}
```

2. Add the plugin row (this repo ships its own `cordis.patch.yml` — either merge its row into your profile's `cordis.patch.yml`, or install via the `dsh plugin` command above which does it for you):

```yaml
# ~/.dsh/profiles/web/cordis.patch.yml
- insert:
    - id: dsh-web-restart
      name: dsh-web-restart
```

3. `pnpm install` in the profile directory, then restart `dsh web`.

## How it works

| Layer | File | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Host | `lib/index.js` | Registers an exact `POST /restart-dsh` route on the webServer; launches the restart script as an independent hidden PowerShell under `danger-full-access` sandbox policy |
| Client | `lib/client.js` | Registers the sidebar footer button (slot `sidebar.footer.action`); single click `fetch`es `POST /restart-dsh`; polls `GET /dsh-health` every 5s for the status dot |
| Bundle | `cordis.patch.yml` | The loader row that mounts both halves |

The host routes return **before** the restart happens (~1s host timer + 3s inner sleep), giving the browser time to render the "restarting" state before the page drops.

### Why not `ctx.timeout` in the route handler

`ctx.timeout` is a Cordis mixin backed by `ctx.effect()`, which is scoped to the Cordis **fiber** lifecycle. A `webServer` route handler runs as a plain Node HTTP callback — outside any fiber — so `ctx.effect`-registered timers are silently dropped and the restart never fires. This plugin uses Node's native `setTimeout` in the handler instead.

## Compatibility

- DeepSeek Harness `0.1.0-rc.6` (web profile).
- The restart script path (`D:\1\dsh-web-host.ps1`) is hard-coded for this author's machine — **fork and adjust it** (or replace the command in `lib/index.js`) for your own environment. Contributions to make this configurable are welcome.

## Development

The client bundle is hand-written in the exact wire format (`window.__ModuleLoader__.load({ id, factory })`), so no build step is required:

```bash
node --check lib/index.js
node --check lib/client.js
```
